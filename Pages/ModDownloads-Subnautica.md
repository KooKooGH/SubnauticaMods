# ♿ Accessibility mods ✅

Mods made for very specific purposes. Unless these issues concern you, I do not recommend the following mods as they may interfere with regular gameplay. The following mods were not made for me and do not necessarily reflect my personal beliefs or opinions- I just want more people to be able to enjoy the game.
